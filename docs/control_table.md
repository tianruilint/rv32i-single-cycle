Source: `rtl/decoder.sv` and `rtl/rv32i_core.sv`, DAY18 checkpoint, 2026-09-21.
This table records current outputs, not a proposed replacement implementation.

## Encoding qualification

All fields below are binary. R-type uses opcode `0110011`; I-type arithmetic
uses `0010011`; LW uses `0000011`; SW uses `0100011`; the branch group uses
`1100011`; LUI uses `0110111`; AUIPC uses `0010111`; JAL uses `1101111`;
and JALR uses `1100111`.

## Decoder outputs

`alu_src`: 0 selects rs2, 1 selects the immediate.
`result_src`: `00` selects the ALU result, `01` external load data, `10` the
U immediate, and `11` `PC+4`. Existing table entries written as 0 or 1 mean
the two-bit values `00` or `01`.
`imm_type`: I=`000`, S=`001`, B=`010`, U=`011`, J=`100`; I is the default
even when unused.
`alu_a_pc`: 0 selects rs1 for ALU operand A; 1 selects current PC.
`jump_type`: none=`00`, JAL=`01`, JALR=`10`.
ALU operation codes here are internal, not ISA funct3 values.

All rows above have `alu_a_pc=0` and `jump_type=00`. The v0.5 rows and their
new controls are:

| Instruction | reg_write | alu_src | mem_write | result_src | branch | imm_type | alu_op | alu_a_pc | jump_type |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- | ---: | --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| LUI | 1 | 0 | 0 | `10` | 0 | U | ADD `0000` | 0 | `00` |
| AUIPC | 1 | 1 | 0 | `00` | 0 | U | ADD `0000` | 1 | `00` |
| JAL | 1 | 0 | 0 | `11` | 0 | J | ADD `0000` | 0 | `01` |
| JALR (`funct3=000`) | 1 | 1 | 0 | `11` | 0 | I | ADD `0000` | 0 | `10` |
| JALR (other funct3) | 0 | 0 | 0 | `00` | 0 | I | ADD `0000` | 0 | `00` |

All outputs receive defaults before the opcode case. Empty/default branches
retain these assignments, rather than retaining a previous instruction's state.

## Core qualification and side effects

- `rf_we` is `reg_write` gated off by reset. The register file separately rejects
  writes to destination x0.
- `data_write_en` is `mem_write` gated off by reset.
- `data_addr` is the full 32-bit effective byte address. The core's memory
  qualification uses `funct3` and the low address bits to select byte/halfword
  lanes and to form `data_write_data` and `data_write_strb[3:0]`.
- LB/LBU/SB select any byte lane. LH/LHU/SH select lanes 0/1 or 2/3 only;
  LW/SW select all four lanes only at a four-byte-aligned address. The strobe
  patterns are SB `0001/0010/0100/1000`, SH `0011/1100`, and SW `1111`.
- `data_write_data` is lane-aligned, and a Python memory model must preserve
  bytes whose strobe bits are zero. The one-word interface does not split or
  assemble misaligned halfword/word accesses and has no misalignment trap.
- `branch_type` uses `NONE=000`, `BEQ=001`, `BNE=010`, `BLT=011`, `BGE=100`,
  `BLTU=101`, and `BGEU=110`. `branch_taken` is `branch` plus the selected
  equality, signed-less-than, unsigned-less-than, or inverse comparison; it
  feeds `take_target`.
- JAL and JALR also feed `take_target`. JAL targets `current_pc + Jimm`; JALR
  targets the ALU sum with bit 0 cleared. Both write `current_pc + 4` to rd.
  LUI writes Uimm directly, while AUIPC adds Uimm to current PC.
- PC reset takes priority over `take_target` inside `pc.sv`.
- Branches do not depend on the selected ALU SUB result for the comparison.
- Shift-immediate upper-field values are checked before enabling SLLI, SRLI, or
  SRAI. Invalid combinations have no register/memory write or branch side effect,
  but PC advances by four when not in reset. No illegal-instruction trap exists.

The decoder unit test is one cocotb case containing 42 legal and boundary
vectors; it is not exhaustive. Its v0.5 vectors include LUI, AUIPC, JAL, a
valid JALR with nonzero immediate upper bits, and an invalid JALR funct3. Valid
OR/SLT and other architectural outcomes
are also exercised by the integrated arithmetic chain;
see [verification_plan.md](verification_plan.md) for the evidence boundary.
