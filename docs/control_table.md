# v0.2 Decoder and Core Control Table

Source: `rtl/decoder.sv` and `rtl/rv32i_core.sv`, DAY15 checkpoint, 2026-09-16.
This table records current outputs, not a proposed replacement implementation.

## Encoding qualification

All fields below are binary. R-type uses opcode `0110011`; I-type arithmetic
uses `0010011`; LW uses `0000011`; SW uses `0100011`; BEQ uses `1100011`.

## Decoder outputs

`alu_src`: 0 selects rs2, 1 selects the immediate.
`result_src`: 0 selects the ALU result, 1 selects external memory read data.
`imm_type`: I=`00`, S=`01`, B=`10`; I is the default even when unused.
ALU operation codes here are internal, not ISA funct3 values.

| Unsupported/invalid | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | I | ADD `0000` |

All outputs receive defaults before the opcode case. Empty/default branches
retain these assignments, rather than retaining a previous instruction's state.

## Core qualification and side effects

- `rf_we` is `reg_write` gated off by reset. The register file separately rejects
  writes to destination x0.
- `data_write_en` is `mem_write` gated off by reset.
- `branch_taken` is `branch && (rs1_data == rs2_data)`; it feeds `take_target`.
- PC reset takes priority over `take_target` inside `pc.sv`.
- BEQ does not depend on the selected ALU SUB result for equality.
- Shift-immediate upper-field values are checked before enabling SLLI, SRLI, or
  SRAI. Invalid combinations have no register/memory write or branch side effect,
  but PC advances by four when not in reset. No illegal-instruction trap exists.

The decoder unit test is one cocotb case containing 22 legal and boundary
vectors; it is not exhaustive. Valid OR/SLT and other architectural outcomes
are also exercised by the integrated arithmetic chain;
see [verification_plan.md](verification_plan.md) for the evidence boundary.
